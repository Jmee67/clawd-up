# TOOLS.md — Researcher Local Notes

## Primary Tools

- **web_search** — Use for all research. Reddit, competitors, market data, pricing.
- **web_fetch** — Fetch specific pages when you need full content.
- **browser** — Last resort. Only when web_search/fetch can't reach content.

## Research Templates

Deep dives go in `/research/deep-dives/`
Validations go in `/research/validations/`

## Notes

_Add environment-specific notes here during setup._
