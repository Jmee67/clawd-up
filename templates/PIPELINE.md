# Pipeline

Track opportunities from signal → validation → build decision.

## Stages

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| SIGNAL | Raw signal identified, needs triage |
| RESEARCHING | Passed triage, being validated |
| VALIDATED | Research complete, ready for scoring |
| SCORED | Scored via rubric, awaiting decision |
| BUILDING | Decided to build, in progress |
| KILLED | Dropped — document why |

## Active Pipeline

## How to Use

1. Scout finds a signal → creates entry at SIGNAL stage
2. Scout or Researcher validates → moves to RESEARCHING
3. After validation, score using RUBRIC.md → SCORED
4. You decide: BUILD or KILL
5. Document reasoning either way

## Killed Opportunities

Track what you killed and why — patterns in kills reveal your real thesis.

| ID | Name | Kill Reason | Date |
