# Tweet Drafts — @Microbuilderco

## Option A: Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
A developer spent 5 days debugging her OpenClaw agent's memory. 77K people read about it. 1.4K bookmarked it. Because they all hit the same walls. Here's what she had to fix — and why none of it should be manual.

**Tweet 2 (Problem → Solution)**
Problem 1: Agent forgets everything after long conversations. Fix: memory flush config + decay scoring. Problem 2: Search returns garbage. Fix: hybrid search with QMD setup. She figured this out through trial and error. We pre-configure both in install.sh.

**Tweet 3 (The numbers)**
She cut her system prompt from 11,887 to 8,529 tokens. Dropped 51 skills to 32. Built handover protocols so compaction doesn't wipe context. Built marker tests to verify memory actually works. That's a week of work for every OpenClaw user.

**Tweet 4 (The pitch)**
Clawd Up ships with all of it. Memory flush. Boot sequence. Handover protocol. Curated skills. LEARNINGS.md. One command, everything configured. She spent 5 days fixing what we pre-configure in install.sh.

**Tweet 5 (CTA)**
If you're running OpenClaw agents and tired of debugging memory, boot sequences, and bloated prompts — try it. clawd-up.vercel.app

## Option B: Standalone tweet

That viral post about 5 days of OpenClaw memory debugging? Every problem she fixed — memory flush, boot sequence, skill bloat, handover protocols — ships pre-configured in Clawd Up. One install command. clawd-up.vercel.app
