## Pain Point Feature Blocks

### Memory That Actually Works
Your agent forgets everything after long conversations. You dig through docs, find the memory flush config, tune decay scores. With Clawd Up, memory flush is pre-configured. Compaction recovery writes context automatically. Your agent remembers.

### Smart Boot Sequence
The agent finds information but doesn't use it. Classic boot sequence problem — it doesn't know to read AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, and memory files on startup. Clawd Up's boot sequence loads identity, user context, and recent memory every session. No configuration needed.

### Token-Efficient by Default
She cut her system prompt from 11,887 to 8,529 tokens. Dropped from 51 skills to 32. That's a 28% reduction she had to figure out manually. Clawd Up ships with curated skills — only what you need, nothing bloating your context window.

### Handover Protocol Built In
Long sessions lose context when compaction kicks in. Her fix: handover protocols that write state before sessions end. Clawd Up includes handover protocol, compaction context files, and hourly summaries out of the box.

### Curated Skills, Not 51 Random Ones
Default OpenClaw installs load every available skill. Most are irrelevant to your use case. Clawd Up audits this for you — pre-selected skills matched to business ops workflows.
