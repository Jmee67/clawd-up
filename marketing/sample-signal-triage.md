## Signal Triage — Feb 26 Evening

### Promoted to Pipeline (1)

**AI-powered invoice matching for construction**
- Pain: 4/5 — 3+ hours daily manual work, multiple confirmations
- Willingness to Pay: 4/5 — "I'd pay $200/mo to stop doing this"
- Competition: 3/5 — Generic AP tools exist, none construction-specific
- Reach: 4/5 — 750k+ construction businesses in US, active Reddit/forum presence
- Build Complexity: 3.5/5 — PDF parsing + matching logic, manageable solo
- **Total: 18.5/25** — PROMOTED to RESEARCHING

### Watching (2)

**Return fraud detection for Shopify**
Score: 14/25 — Pain is real but competition is heavy (Returnly, Loop, Narvar). Needs a specific wedge to differentiate. Watching for 7 days.

**AI writing tool for non-English markets**
Score: 12/25 — Large market but generic AI wrapper pattern. Kill pattern match: "AI wrapper in saturated market." Watching but likely skip.

### Skipped (4)

| Signal | Reason | Kill Pattern |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Crypto portfolio tracker | Saturated, 50+ tools | Crowded market, no wedge |
| AI pet name generator | No willingness to pay | Toy product, no revenue path |
| Social media scheduler | Dominated by Buffer/Hootsuite | Incumbent moat too deep |
| Handmade marketplace | Physical product logistics | Physical fulfillment |
