**1. AI-powered invoice matching for construction**
Source: Reddit r/construction (147 upvotes, 43 comments)
Signal: "We spend 3 hours a day matching POs to invoices. There has to be a better way."
Bleeding neck score: 4.2/5 — active pain, willingness to pay evident in thread.

**2. Shopify merchants need better return fraud detection**
Source: HN comment thread (Show HN: Return abuse cost me $40k)
Signal: 12+ merchants confirming same problem in comments.
Bleeding neck score: 3.8/5 — pain is real but solutions exist (Returnly, Loop). Needs wedge analysis.

Source: X trending topic + Reddit r/freelance
Signal: "Lost 3 clients this month who switched to ChatGPT for copywriting."
Bleeding neck score: 2.1/5 — trend signal, not a product opportunity. Watching.
